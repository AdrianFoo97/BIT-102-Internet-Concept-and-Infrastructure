	<h1 id="aries">ARIES</h1>
	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor1">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style1">
		<p>Aries is ruled by Mars, the fiery red planet of energy and drive. In mythology, Mars was the god of war and aggression. Highly impatient and competitive, many Aries have the fighting spirit of your mythological ruler. You love to be a hero–or to be swept away by one. As the zodiac’s first sign, you were born to be number one. You’re a solo star who steals the spotlight and inspires everyone with your confidence. Yeah, you can be impatient, even a little bossy, especially when you don’t get your way. As the “baby” of the zodiac, you need lots of attention, and can throw quite the tantrum when you don’t get it. Fortunately, you rarely have a problem turning heads. Your friends love to follow as you lead them on the latest adventure. Make sure to let other people be the boss every now and then, too, or you could alienate potential allies. 
		Focus your competitive streak into a diva-worthy goal, delegate to your troops, and you’ll rise to the top!</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Energetic, encouraging, unstoppable, bold, devoted, heroic, caring</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Proud, self-centered, impulsive, bossy, stubborn, reckless, jealous</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Video games, new clothes, road trips (in fast red cars), mind games, expressing themselves through conversation</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Sharing their toys, being ignored, cramped spaces, losing, the word “no”</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To be number one</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> High foreheads, focused or manic energy, aggressive stance</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them:</b> Earning a fifth degree black belt, writing and producing a solo album, working on Wall Street, trying out for American Idol</p><br><br>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor2">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style2">
		<p>Sensual Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty. Your sign loves great food, romance and beautiful things. Venus kicks your five senses into high gear, so you are are happiest when surrounded by the best of everything. 
		Satin sheets, gourmet dinners, a glass of red wine, and boom…you’re relaxing into one of your famous, 14-hour naps. Not that you don’t work hard, too. Like a bull, Taurus operates at two speeds: either totally relaxed, or charging headfirst towards a target. 
		You prefer to keep the peace, but when you’re pushed past your limit, watch out! Underneath it all, you just want to be comfortable, and surrounded by life’s finest offerings. Taurus knows what s/he likes, and that’s that. You stick with your opinions, and you don’t change unless there’s a really good reason. 
		You can be stubborn…but on the upside, you’re also loyal and dependable. Just be careful not to get stuck in a safety zone or your life could become stagnant. Take a chance and try something new. Sometimes, change and risk can bring the progress and reward you’re wishing for.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Patient, organized, supportive, romantic, careful, dedicated</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Overindulgent, stubborn, lazy, vain, cheap, too cautious</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Photography, the mountains, really good music, really good food, satin sheets</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Being rushed, wasting money, dirty things, hotels, mornings</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To own the best of everything</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Deep and soulful eyes, long and elegant necks, delicate jaw lines</p>

	<h1 id="gemini">GEMINI</h1>
	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor3">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style3">
		<p>The Gemini mind (and mouth!) is a busy machine, always moving at warp speed. That’s because your sign is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication. Mercury also rules technology and the mind, making Gemini one of the most curious and cutting-edge signs of the zodiac. 
		If two is double the fun, then as the sign of the twins, you know it’s true! There are at least two personalities inside of you at all times. Adventurous Geminis change faster than the weather, and constantly flip between moods and interests. One day, you’re into frilly, girl stuff. 
		The next day, you’re over that and skydiving out of an airplane. If possible, try to stick with a couple key passions for the long haul, and get really good at them. You love to chatter and you have a million great ideas. Keep your fast-moving mind and hands busy with email, instant messages, mobile gadgets, and great conversations. 
		Watch a temptation to gossip. Keep a notebook handy to jot down your thoughts at all times.</p>
		<p><b>Good Days:</b> Fascinating, original, resourceful, charming, wise, adventurous</p>
		<p><b>Bad Days:</b> Restless, distracted, two-faced, judgmental, depressed, overwhelmed</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Cell phones, fast cars, trendy clothes, obscure music, guitars, books, comedy clubs</p>
		<p><b>What they Hate:</b> Small-minded people, dress codes, authority figures, silence, routines</p>
		<p><b>Secret wish: </b>To have all the answers</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Mischievous twinkle in their eyes, reading, talking with their hands</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them:</b> Behind the camera, behind the deejay booth, in a chat room, arguing both sides on the debate team</p>

	<h1 id="cancer">CANCER</h1>
	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor4">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style4">
		<p>Sensitive Cancer is ruled by the ever-changing Moon, and your moods go through many cycles. You’re intuitive and nurturing, even psychic. 	
		Pay attention to your dreams, especially near a Full Moon. You are sensitive and loyal, with a ready shoulder to cry on. Cancer loves to get domestic, serving your friends and family home-baked goodies and tea. When you get moody, you need to be comforted, or else just left alone. 
		Like a crab, you can cling — or pinch — when you feel threatened or vulnerable. And thrifty Cancers can pinch pennies just as tightly. (Of course, you also love to spend! It’s a mood thing.) To make life easier, surround yourself with comfort: a cozy sweater, a favorite book, trusted friends, and a stash of your favorite goodies. Cancers are close to their moms, so keep yours on speed-dial and call her when you’re down. You may be an unofficial mom to everyone in your life, too. Taking care of kids, friends, and pets can keep your spirits high.</p>
		<p><b>Good Days:</b> Helpful, patient, compassionate, nurturing, romantic, creative</p>
		<p><b>Bad Days:</b> Gossipy, clique-y, isolated, uncommunicative, hypersensitive, overly competitive</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Gourmet meals, intramural sports, hosting parties, working with kids, museums and art galleries</p>
		<p><b>What they Hate:</b> Tacky clothes, frozen dinners, public speaking, being rushed, paying full price</p>
		<p><b>Secret wish:</b> To take care of friends and family</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Walking with their chests puffed out, round “moon-like” facial features</p>

	<h1 id="leo">LEO</h1>
	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor5">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style5">
		<p>The Sun is the center of our solar system and the ruler of Leo. When the whole universe revolves around you, it’s hard to be humble! Like the Sun, Leo heats everything up with its dazzling drama. And when the Sun sets, it’s ice, ice baby. 
		That’s why friends of Leo know to keep them happy and shining…or else. Leo is the sign of drama, and oh, can you put on a show! Even the Leos who pretend to be shy come to life in the spotlight. A natural-born leader, you love to be the boss. 
		Leos need mega-doses of praise and appreciation, which may cause people to think you’re self-centered. The truth is, you have a huge heart, and you’re the zodiac’s most generous sign. You’re always there to help, spoil, and protect the people you love. 
		So what if your appetite is huge? Your energy may be hard for others to match. Remember, people express love in different ways, and not everyone can show it like you do. But it’s never boring to be part of your glamorous world, so let your star shine. 
		Somebody’s gotta rule, and it might as well be you!</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b>  Courageous, kind, generous, loyal, protective, nakedly honest, entertaining</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b>  Arrogant, wasteful, sloppy, cold-hearted, jealous, aggressive</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b>  Theaters, cameras, DVDs, rich desserts, red roses, exchanging gifts, singing, affection, compliments, great clothes</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b>  Being ignored, silver medals (instead of gold), bland food, being alone, goodbyes</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b>  To rule the world</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b>  Distinctive mane of hair, regal posture</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them</b> : Producing, directing and starring in their own independent films, swept away in a romantic escapade, running for President</p>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor6">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style6">
		<p>Detail-oriented Virgo is ruled by Mercury, planet of the mind and communication. Virgos are always analyzing everything, forming opinions and judgments. On the outside, you seem sweet and innocent, but your quick mind never misses a detail. 
		Virgo is also the sign of service, and you’re always there when help is needed. You’re an amazing, careful listener, and as a result, you give the best advice. You love to analyze everything! In fact, you can drive yourself crazy, because you never stop thinking. 
		Virgo is a perfectionist who sees every flaw, and at times, you’re a little too critical. Relax your mind by channeling it into a project, like solving a crossword puzzle, writing a story, or organizing your desk. As an earth sign, you love the outdoors, so chill out in nature, or try a sport like karate. 
		Remember, it’s easy for helpful Virgo to give, but harder for you to receive. Let your friends pitch in and support you, too! Try opening up a little more. You don’t have to be perfect to be loveable. Just be yourself.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Dedicated, resourceful, helpful, hardworking, witty, practical</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Preachy, self-destructive, overwhelmed, self-pitying, uptight, critical</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Laptops, magazines, long showers with aromatherapy soaps, outdoor concerts, childhood friends, Trivial Pursuit</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Lazy or vulgar people, dive bars, spicy food, leaving home, toothpaste squeezed from the top of the tube</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To be a hero</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Baby faces, roving eyes that are sizing up or analyzing a situation</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them:</b> Babysitting for the neighbor’s kids, running errands on their endlessly long to-do lists, building something with their own two hands, cleaning something to spotless condition</p>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor7">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style7">
		<p>Gentle Libra is ruled by Venus, planet of beauty and love. Perhaps that explains your smooth talk and pretty face. Like Taurus, which is also Venus-ruled, Libras love to be surrounded by art, culture and beauty in a soft, harmonious environment. 
		You love good food and expensive things. Lovely Libra knows how to charm but behind your dimples and sweet personality, you’re a fighter. Libra is the sign of the scales, and you can’t stand anything that’s unfair or unbalanced. You love a designer outfit as much as you adore a good debate. 
		You’ll stand up for justice, and you’ll do it with style. Libra hates to be rushed–you prefer that everything happen your way, on your time. If that means you’re ten hours late, so be it. You’re a social butterfly who loves to be surrounded by people in a beautiful setting, talking and hanging out for hours. 
		Just remember to save some time for yourself. Libras can get so caught up in the moment, they forget to handle their own responsibilities. Learn the beauty of being organized, and you’ll have all the time in the world to enjoy your beautiful life.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Charming, lovable, fair, sincere, sharing, hopelessly romantic</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Vain, indecisive, melodramatic, manipulative, spoiled, delusional</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Concerts at large venues, poetry, expensive jewelry, designer clothes, rich food</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Dull or practical people, bullies, being pressured to decide, saying goodnight, hearing the word “maybe”</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To love and be loved in return</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Small symmetrical features, dimples, gentle eyes, outrageous designer outfits</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them:</b> Dancing the night away at a warehouse party, philosophizing about life at a coffeeshop, tucked away at home writing a novel, procrastinating, happily mingling at a social event</p>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor8">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style8">
		<p>Intense Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, planet of power and control. Pluto is a tiny powerhouse, and a bit of a mystery; in mythology Pluto was the god of the underworld. Many Scorpios are also drawn to “dark” things, and often wear the color black, or a shocking tone like red or hot pink. 
		Like Pluto, Scorpio’s power often emanates from a hidden source, even when you don’t say a word. Mysterious Scorpio is the zodiac’s most misunderstood sign. You’re so powerful that people feel your presence, even before you’ve said a word! Sensitive Scorpio picks up vibes. 
		You see every little detail, and you can read people like an open book. Once your friends get used to your high-intensity style, they know that you’re fiercely loyal. Anyone who betrays you had better watch out! Like a Scorpion, you’ll deliver a painful sting of revenge. 
		Since your sign is naturally secretive, work on being more open with people. This will develop trust, and improve your relationships. Scorpio’s concentration powers are amazing, but be careful not to get obsessed. Curb any jealous or possessive feelings by pouring your energy into a creative project or passion.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Magnetic, passionate, loyal, protective, trendsetting, brave</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Obsessive, possessive, jealous, secretive, vengeful, manipulative</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Underground music, spicy food, an air of danger, one-of-a-kind objects, wireless devices, organic ingredients, vinyl</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Simple-minded people, insincere flattery, personal questions, living at someone else’s house</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To have complete and total control</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Intense eyes, a hawk-like gaze, smooth movements</p>
		<p><b>Where You’ll Find Them:</b> In the studio producing a platinum album, sitting at the corner table of an underground bar, taking things apart and figuring how to put them back together again</p>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor9">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style9">
		<p>Cheerful Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter is the “happy” planet, full of energy and confidence. Sagittarians often reflect Jupiter’s larger-than-life persona. As the zodiac’s traveler, Sagittarius is the ultimate free spirit: optimistic, open-minded and ambitious. 
		You’re happiest in wide-open spaces with plenty of adventure and excitement. You juggle a million projects, hobbies and friends. The more, the merrier! Sagittarius is forever pursuing a super-sized goal. Even when you fail, nothing can keep you down. You’ll chalk it up as a life lesson and inspire everyone with tales of your experience.
		As the sign of wisdom and truth, Sagittarius loves to “tell it like it is,” especially when it makes people laugh. However, your honesty doesn’t always come in the prettiest package. You’ve been known to bruise feelings with your bluntness. Cultivate patience, and be careful not to come off as a know-it-all. 
		Although Sag loves the thrill of a new project or friendship, you don’t always finish what you start. Work on keeping your promises and commitments.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Honest, fair-minded, inspiring, optimistic, enthusiastic, encouraging, dedicated</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Argumentative, reckless, flaky, preachy, tactless, overconfident</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Dares, flirting, pets, pop music, international travel, laughter, karaoke, books, inspirational stories</p>

		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To make the rules</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Strong legs, laughing eyes, comedic facial expressions</p>

	<div class="horoscope" id="bgcolor10">
		<div class="paragraph" id="style10">
		<p>Serious Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of tough lessons and wisdom. As a result, many Capricorns are “old souls” who play by the rules and follow tradition. Accustomed to regular butt-kickings from Saturn, you often see life as an uphill battle, with the ultimate reward arriving only through suffering and sacrifice. 
		Ambitious Capricorn is symbolized by a mountain goat climbing up a rocky hill, taking one cautious step at a time. And that’s exactly how patient Caps like to do everything. You’ll skip the good stuff today if it means getting the reward tomorrow. That’s why your sign has more trophies and loyal friends than any other–you stay strong through the hard times. 
		Hardworking Caps are devoted to their friends and families, and people count on you for support. You always keep your word. Remember to let yourself have fun, too! Life doesn’t always have to be a struggle. It’s okay to enjoy your victories, even if you didn’t work hard to win them. Lighten up and share your wacky, down-to-earth humor. 
		When you get moody, let your family and closest friends be there for you–just as you always are for them.</p>
		<p><b>Good Day:</b> Loyal, family-minded, hardworking, devoted, honest, fearless</p>
		<p><b>Bad Day:</b> Pessimistic, unforgiving, cold, materialistic, snobbish, hopeless</p>
		<p><b>Favorite Things:</b> Business cards, goals, official titles, being in charge, exclusive clubs, “leg sports” like soccer or track, motorcycles, leather</p>
		<p><b>What You Hate:</b> Quitting, shouting in public, careless mistakes, traveling without an itinerary, doing things “just for the heck of it”</p>
		<p><b>Secret Wish:</b> To have every need taken care of</p>
		<p><b>How to Spot Them:</b> Distinctive jaw, strong teeth, wise look in the eyes</p>

		<p>Aquarius is the sign of friendship, and chances are, you’ve got plenty of pals. Although you may look like the boy/girl next door, you love to be around unusual people and ideas. 
		You know how to step back and find the perfect solution to any problem. And you can make friends with almost anyone! Aquarius rules surprises and originality, and you love to shock people. 
		Just when they think they’ve got you figured out, you change the game. Practical jokes are your specialty. People love to be around you, because you’re so accepting and fun. 
		Remember to give some of that love to yourself, too. You make a great leader and can really stand out from the crowd. Your sign is ruled by Uranus, planet of revolution and electricity. 
		Aquarians are ultra-modern, always into the latest gadget or concept. Like unpredictable Uranus, your temper can flare out of nowhere. When you’re upset, Aquarians can deliver a trademark lightening bolt that strikes with a force shocking even to you.</p>

		<p>Pisces is symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions. A part of you is always trying to “swim away” or escape reality. The other part is so intuitive that you get swept up in everything going on. 
		Your imagination is the perfect hideout when you want to escape, since Pisces is so creative. You love dancing (Pisces rules the feet), movies, poetry, and music. Your moods are mysterious and your dreams are intense. 
		Every Pisces should have a journal by your bed, since some your best ideas will come in your sleep. Although you can feel helpless, you’re much stronger than you think. The best way for Pisces to experience your own strength is to help people in need. 
		You have great compassion and incredible healing powers. Because it’s easy for people to make you feel guilty, Pisces should watch out for friends who use you, or make you doubt yourself. Surround yourself with good-hearted friends who have their acts together. 
		Many people born under your sign have a “tortured soul” quality. Finding a tranquil spiritual outlet, or spending time alone, can help you get re-centered in your own power.</p>
